        <h1 class="main-heading">Pre Workout Meals</h1>

        <h1>1. Bananas</h1>

        <p>
          Known as nature’s power bar, bananas are packed with carbohydrates and
          potassium, which supports nerve and muscle function. Carbs are fuel
          for our body and brain, and they account for 90% of banana calories.
        </p>

        <h1 id="pre">2. Oats</h1>

        <p>
          Because they are full of fiber, oats release carbohydrates gradually.
          Due to this slow release, energy levels are kept consistent throughout
          your workout, meaning you can train harder for longer. They also
          contain Vitamin B, which helps convert carbohydrates into energy.
          Irish oats are often considered the best, as they are the least
          processed type and boast a lower glycemic load than quick-cooking and
          instant oats. 3. Grilled Chicken, Broccoli, And Sweet Potato If you
          are working on building muscle mass or plan to hit circuit training
          hard, then this combo is a must-try.
        </p>

        <h1>4. Dried Fruit</h1>

        <p>
          For a quick, easy and good pre-workout food, fix yourself some dried
          berries, apricots, figs, and pineapple. Dried fruits are a good source
          of simple carbohydrates that are easily digestible – so grab a
          handful.
        </p>

        <h1>5. Whole Grain Bread</h1>

        <p>
          One slice of whole grain bread is an excellent source of carbs. Add
          some hard-boiled eggs for a protein-packed snack, or some low-fat
          turkey.
        </p>

        <h1>5. Fruit And Greek Yogurt</h1>

        <p>
          This is a killer combo. The fruit is full of carbohydrates while Greek
          yogurt packs a protein-filled punch. Compared to regular yogurt, Greek
          yogurt has almost double the protein, fewer carbs, and half the
          sodium. Why do they go together? The carbs in the fruit break down
          quickly and are used as fuel during your workout, while the protein is
          stored a little longer and is used to prevent muscle damage, so it
          really is a perfect pairing.
        </p>

        <h1>6. Trail Mix</h1>
        <p>
          Nuts do have a high-fat content, but they provide the protein and
          calories required if you are trying to gain muscle mass. For those
          whose goal is weight loss, steer clear. If you want to buy
          pre-prepared trail mix from supermarkets, skip the ones containing
          chocolate or yogurt -coated nuts.

        <h1 class="main-heading">Post Workout Meals</h1>

        <h1>1. Protein-packed Trail Mix</h1>
        <p>
          Trail mix made with soy nuts makes a great post-workout fuel because
          it provides the ideal carbohydrate-to-protein ratio without driving up
          the fat content. Take a to-go container of this mix with you and enjoy
          it.
        </p>

        <h1>2. Honey Ricotta with Strawberries</h1>

        <p>
          You can neatly package this simple snack into meal-prep containers, so
          you can easily grab it after your workouts throughout the week. Its
          combo of protein and carbs will help you repair muscle and replenish
          energy stores.
        </p>

        <h1>3. Protein Shake</h1>

        <p>
          This shake is designed to target everything the body needs
          post-workout. “Cherries are loaded with inflammation-fighting
          antioxidants.
        </p>

        <h1>4. Sweet and Salty Chickpeas</h1>

        <p>
          Chickpeas, aka garbanzo beans, provide a nice balance of carbs and
          protein perfect for a post-workout snack. You can dress this recipe up
          sweet with a touch of honey, or make it spicy with a sprinkle of
          cayenne pepper and cumin.

        <h1>Black Bean Pasta</h1>
        <p>
          Black bean pasta is made from just black bean flour, and offers 14
          grams of protein, a whopping 15 grams of fiber, and 35 grams of carbs
          per 200-calorie serving, says Wright. Like edamame noodles, black bean
          pasta is higher in calories—but those calories are more balanced with
          protein and fiber than plain old pasta. Plus, it provides about a
          quarter of your daily iron needs, says Wright. Black bean pasta is
          perfect for a quick weeknight Mexican dish. “While the pasta is
          cooking, sauté garlic, onions, some frozen corn, and spinach in a
          sauce pan,” suggests Jones. Toss your veggies into the pasta and top
          with salsa and avocado.

        <h1>Oats porridge recipe</h1>
        <p>
          Oats porridge recipe with step by step pics – quick oats porridge made
          with quick-cooking oats or rolled oats. This is an easy, low-fat
          porridge made in just 6 minutes. Oats porridge is one porridge I had a
          dislike for a long time. It was one food which was given to me twice
          or thrice every day as a toddler and even later. Sometimes too much of
          anything does more harm than good. So naturally, I avoided oats in my
          life like anything.

          Halve eggs and transfer the yolks to a large bowl. Add mayonnaise,
          Dijon, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and mix to combine. Using a
          sandwich bag with the corner snipped off, pipe the mixture into the

          Place chicken in a large pot with onion, carrots, celery and
          peppercorns; add water to cover. Cover pot and bring to a boil; reduce
          heat to a gentle boil and cook for about 90 minutes, or until chicken
          meat is falling off of the bone. Remove chicken, let cool and shred or
          chop the meat.
